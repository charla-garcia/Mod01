This report is for the digital forensics’ examination of an acquired evidence file from a USB drive found in an apartment involving a suspicious death. The victim is the girlfriend of a Mr. Joshua Zarkan. Data from the USB drive was copied by the assigned evidence technician at the apartment. The copied evidence file name is Project_01-1.001. The detective assigned to the case directed me to examine the digital evidence that is in file Project_01-1.001 to see if there might be any information relating to the death. 

Using Autopsy for Windows, I located two files of interest to the case: "suicide1.txt" and "Sylvias Assets.xls." The file suicide1.txt contained the statement of: “______________________________________________.” The file Sylvias Assets.xls contains the following information:

Stocks: ________________   
Bonds: ______________  
Real Estate: ____________   
Annuities: _________________  
Savings Account: ____________  
Life Insurance: _________________  
**Total: _______________________**

From the information found in these two files additional investigation into the victim’s mental condition and the character or Mr. Zarkan should move forward by the detective.
